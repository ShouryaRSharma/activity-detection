# Suspicious Activity Detection System

The Suspicious Activity Detection System is a Python application that monitors a live video stream from an IP camera, detects suspicious activity using the Moondream image-text vision model, and logs security events using Mixtral. The system follows SOLID principles to ensure a modular, extensible, and maintainable architecture.
